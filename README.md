Parkinson's disease (PD) progression prediction is a crucial aspect of early diagnosis and management. This study employs machine learning algorithms to enhance predictive models, focusing on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Score (UPDRS) using the Parkinson's Telemonitoring Dataset. The research explores various methodologies, including ensemble learning and MLP, drawing insights from related works. Feature engineering strategies, such as multicollinearity removal, contribute to model stability. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is adopted as the performance metric for consistency with prior studies. Experimental findings spotlight the Decision Tree Regressor, boasting an MAE of 0.7131, as a notable performer.

## Model Deployment with Streamlit
We have utilized Streamlit, an open-source app framework tailored for machine learning and Data Science teams. Streamlit empowers the rapid development of websites with a focus on simplicity and efficiency.

### Accessing the Deployed Model
Upon deployment, Streamlit will generate a unique URL for accessing your deployed model. You can find this URL in the following format:
```
Your URL is: [provided URL]
```
To interact with your deployed model, follow these steps:
1. Click on the provided URL in your terminal or command prompt.
2. Upon accessing the provided URL, you will be prompted to provide your IP address.

### Obtaining Your IP Address
To retrieve your IP address, run the following command:
```
!wget -q -O - ipv4.icanhazip.com
```

Execute this command in your terminal or command prompt, and the output will display your IP address.

Parkinson's disease (PD) progression prediction is a crucial aspect of early diagnosis and management. This study employs machine learning algorithms to enhance predictive models, focusing on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Score (UPDRS) using the Parkinson's Telemonitoring Dataset. The research explores various methodologies, including ensemble learning and MLP, drawing insights from related works. Feature engineering strategies, such as multicollinearity removal, contribute to model stability. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is adopted as the performance metric for consistency with prior studies. Experimental findings spotlight the Decision Tree Regressor, boasting an MAE of 0.7131, as a notable performer.
